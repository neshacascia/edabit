# edabit
This is a collection of my edabit solutions which are divided by their levels (very easy-expert). <br>
Each .js file represented one challenge solved. 
<br>
<br>
## How It's Made:
All challenges are solved with JavaScript. I push a minimum of 7 solutions every week. 
<br>
<br>
## Optimizations
As I continue to learn, I plan on revisiting my completed solutions to refactor and optimize my code to improve its readability and efficiency.
<br>
I'm looking forward to seeing my progress!
