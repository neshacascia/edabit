// 50-30-20 Strategy:
// The 50-30-20 strategy is a simple way to budget, which involves spending 50% of after-tax income on needs,
// 30% after tax income on wants, and 20% after-tax income on savings or paying off debt.

// Given the after-tax income as ati, what you are supposed to do is to make a function that will return an
// object that shows how much a person needs to spend on needs, wants, and savings.

function fiftyThirtyTwenty(ati) {
  return {
    Needs: ati * 0.5,
    Wants: ati * 0.3,
    Savings: ati * 0.2,
  };
}
